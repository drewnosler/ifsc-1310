    <h2>First Private Spacecraft to the Space Station</h2>
    <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. </p>
    <p>It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</p>

<!--- I have revised this assignment to the best of my ability and reviewed this project to several of my fmaily members and friends and they all recommended that nothing needed to change and they thought the project was really good. Personally in my opinion, this class isn't for me and coding html and css and js was hard for me to grasp and understand. And with all this COVID-19 stuff going on really pushed me back on my work hours for school and studying. But the time I've had in this class to learn was taught to me was really cool. I enjoyed the creativity you can do in css and js and learning how to put these pieces together by adding interesting content elements that are pretty basic.
In the beginning in this semester I had major trouble keeping up with this class due to internet speeds and keeping pace on the computer and rather not face to face with a teacher. What I've felt like I did best in was html more than anything because the way it's formatted to me was the easiest to learn and the most basic. What I would do all over again was invest much more time into these assignments because I've always had no time to finish these assignments because of how long it took me to finally understand what the material I'm learning means how to make it work. I've never done anything like this before and it's intereseting to see but not my best interest.
All the feedback I've been given by family members and a few friends were to maybe change a few pictures in the slideshows but that was it. They said that the fonts were fine, the css was fine, and that the images were pretty good to see. Not much has been changed to the project due to the advice I was given.
I apologize for the seemingly lack of effort that I've put into this class but this subject to me is very hard and next semester I'm quitting my work due to lack of time I haven't been getting for school. Thank you Mr Wallace for teaching all that you know and I will use this information to guide myself to my future potential career.--->
